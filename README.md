# codenames_backend

This project is for a browser version of a popular board game called Codenames designed by Vlaada Chvatil. This game was designed on the front end using Javascript and is supported by a backend API using Ruby/Rails with a Postgres db. 

To play, clone this repository along with the frontend repository found at https://github.com/jmr-1/codenames_frontend . Using the terminal, run the following in the backend directory:
>db:migrate
>db:seed
>rails server 

Then open index.html from the front end folder. You can play with the code cards hidden from view of other players with a multi-screen setup. Game logic programmed for the entire game. Enjoy!
